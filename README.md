# playing-pool-with-pi
An elegant but least efficient method to compute the value of Ï€.

Thank you 3Blue1Brown for the inspiration! This is a simple program to find the number of collisions in a perfectly elastic environment of two blocks. However, if the ratio between the two masses is 100^n:1 for any 'n' greater than 0, the number of collisions is same as the digits of pi. In addition, it also finds the number of collisions between any two masses.

This pattern was found by Dr. Gregory Galepin in 2003. I highly suggest to read his [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266523056_Playing_pool_with_p_the_number_p_from_a_billiard_point_of_view).

To understand the environment for this elegant pattern, I suggest to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs&t=170s) video. The solution for this pattern can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE).
